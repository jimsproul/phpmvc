# phpmvc

A Php tool kit for building a web site based on the MVC design pattern. It is codded in Object Oriented Php. 
This is an Open-Source project, see the included MIT License. It is loosely based on Open-source code  Brad Traversy designed for his Object Oriented MVC Course. 

## Tools Used

Only jQuery, Bootstrap and Font-awesome have been used to make the UI more pleasant.

I used the latest version of xampp release 7.3.27  (https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) to demo this code. It included Php 8, Apache & MariaDB.
