# phpmvc - A Php MVC Toolkit

A Php tool kit for building a web site based on the MVC design pattern. It is codded in Object Oriented Php. This code was design to offer a simple means of getting a workable MVC site going without all the excess baggage found in some (All?) modern Php frameworks.

This is an Open-Source project, see the included MIT License. It is loosely based on Open-source code  Brad Traversy designed for his Object Oriented MVC Course. 

### Tools Used

Only jQuery, Bootstrap and Font-awesome have been used to make the UI more pleasant.
